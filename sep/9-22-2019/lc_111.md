# Minimum depth binary treee  

Since we are trying to find the depth of the tree we should heavily consider 
using a depth first traversal.

First we can start with a depth first traversal
```python
class Solution:
  def minDepth(self, root):
    if root is None: return None
    self.minDepth(root.left)
    self.minDepth(root.Right)
```

Some things we can gleam from the example is that a single node is treated as 
depth 1. So a empty tree would be considered as depth 0. We can start with 
using that as our base case. Also since we are trying to find the **min** depth 
of the tree we should find the minimum depth between the left and right paths 
and that will form part of our inductive step.

```python
class Solution:
  def minDepth(self, root):
    if root is None: return 0
    return 1 + min(
      self.minDepth(root.left),
      self.minDepth(root.right)
    )
```

However, this solution will only work for a particular type of binary trees 
called a full binary tree, which is a binary tree where all nodes either has 0 
or 2 children.

If a node has 1 child then it incorrectly reports a empty branch as the 
minimum of that path. To fix this we should only consider a path to have 
reached the end when a node has no children instead of a node being `None`.

```python
class Solution:
  def minDepth(self, root):
    def _minDepth(root):
      if root is None: return float('inf')
      if root.left is None and root.right is None: return 1

      return 1 + min(
        _minDepth(root.left),
        _minDepth(root.right)
      )

    if root is None: return 0
    return _minDepth(root)
```
