### Leet Code problem 515 - Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row

The problems is self explanatory based on the title.  

We start off with a method called largestValues

```python
class Solution:
  def largestValues(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
```

First off since we want the largest value of each row then a breadth first 
traversal seems like a good fit since breadth first goes through all the nodes 
row by row.  

We can use a deque instead of a list since it gives us the method 
`Deque#popleft` which is more performant than `List#pop(0)` or 
`del my_list[0]`.  

First lets just do a breadth first traversal of a tree.

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
  def largestValues(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
    queue = deque(root)
    while len(deque) > 0:
      node = queue.popleft()
      if node.left is not None: queue.append(node.left)
      if node.right is not None: queue.append(node.right)    
```

Now we need to somehow keep track of the levels of each node to find out the 
maximum value of each level.

As we traverse through the tree we can store the value of the node and the 
level it was on in a dictionary.  

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
  def largestValues(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
    # store the node, and its value in a tuple since we won't be modifying it
    level_max_num = {}
    queue = deque(( root, 0 ))

    while len(deque) > 0:
      node, level = queue.popleft()
      if node.left is not None: queue.append(node.left)
      if node.right is not None: queue.append(node.right)
      if level not in level_max_num: 
        level_max_num[level] = []

      level_max_num[level].append(node.val)

    return [ max(values) for values in level_max_num.values ]
```

Instead of saving all the values for each level we can keep track of the 
highest value we've seen for each level instead if we use an extra conditional

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
  def largestValues(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
    # store the node, and its value in a tuple since we won't be modifying it
    level_max_num = {}
    queue = deque(( root, 0 ))

    while len(deque) > 0:
      node, level = queue.popleft()
      if node.left is not None: queue.append(node.left)
      if node.right is not None: queue.append(node.right)

      new_val = node.val
      if level not in level_max_num: 
        level_max_num[level] = new_val
      else if new_val > level_max_num[level]:
        level_max_num[level] = new_val

    return level_max_num.values
```

And that's our solution. One last thing to note is that due to the way we 
solved this problem it doesn't really matter if we did breadth first traversal 
or depth first traversal.
