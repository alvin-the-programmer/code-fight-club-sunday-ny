### Leet Code problem 217 - Binary Tree Paths

We are tasked to find all paths from the root of a tree to all its leaves and 
return those paths in a list

We are provided the following definition for a tree node from leet code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```

First, we need to consider which method to traverse the tree between breadth 
first or depth first  

Since we are trying to find paths to leaves then depth first seems like a better
 fit since it goes all the way down until it hits a leaf  

Additionally solving this problem recursively would be a perfect fit. When we 
make recursive calls, stack frames are added onto the call **stack**

We can start with our base case. Because a empty tree also counts as a tree we 
can make our base case around that fact.

```python
class Solution:
  def binaryTreePaths(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[str]:
    if root is None: return []
```

Next we should work on the recursive step. To just get the depth first traversal
we can just recursively call the method `binaryTreePaths()` on the left and 
right children of the root

```python
class Solution:
  def binaryTreePaths(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[str]:
    if root is None: return []
    left_path = self.binaryTreePaths(root.left)
    right_path = self.binaryTreePaths(root.right)
```

If we consider a simple tree

```
    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \
d   e
```

The answer for this tree would be

```python
['a->b->d','a->b->e', 'a->c']
```

And the recursive call on the left child of the node `a` should return

```python
['b->d', 'b->e']
```

So we should prepend our own value before each element in the list, including 
the arrow

Our code should now look like

```python
class Solution:
  def binaryTreePaths(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[str]:
    if root is None: return []
    all_paths = []

    left_path = self.binaryTreePaths(root.left)
    right_path = self.binaryTreePaths(root.right)

    # we first concat the lists together then iterate through the combined lists
    for path in left_path + right_path:
      new_path = str(root.val) + '->' + path
      all_paths.append(new_path)

    return all_paths
```

However, there is a bug with the code as it is. When we reach a leaf, the left 
and right paths are empty lists so when we try to iterate through them we exit 
the loop immediately. We could then return a empty list (since we wouldn't add 
anything to `all_paths`) to the previous recursive call and that would repeat 
giving us a final output of a empty list.

To fix that we just account for if `all_paths` is empty, if it is then we are a 
leaf node and we can return a new list with our value in the list. Now we have 
a non empty list to work with when we return that list to the previous recursive
 call

```python
class Solution:
  def binaryTreePaths(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[str]:
    if root is None: return []
    all_paths = []

    left_path = self.binaryTreePaths(root.left)
    right_path = self.binaryTreePaths(root.right)

    # we first concat the lists together then iterate through the combined lists
    for path in left_path + right_path:
      new_path = str(root.val) + '->' + path
      all_paths.append(new_path)

    if len(all_paths) == 0:
      return [ str(root.val) ]
    else:
      return all_paths
```

This is a correct solution but we can do some final refactoring. We can use 
list comprehensions instead of the for loop.

```python
class Solution:
  def binaryTreePaths(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[str]:
    if root is None: return []

    left_path = self.binaryTreePaths(root.left)
    right_path = self.binaryTreePaths(root.right)

    all_paths = [ str(root.val) + '->' + path for path in left_path + right_path ]

    if len(all_paths) == 0:
      return [ str(root.val) ]
    else:
      return all_paths
```
